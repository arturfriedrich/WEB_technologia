    <h1>ASCII ART</h1>
    <p>ASCII art is a graphic design technique that uses computers for presentation and consists of pictures pieced 
        together from the 95 printable (from a total of 128) characters defined by the ASCII Standard from 1963 and 
        ASCII compliant character sets with proprietary extended characters (beyond the 128 characters of standard 
        7-bit ASCII). The term is also loosely used to refer to text-based visual art in general. ASCII art can be 
        created with any text editor, and is often used with free-form languages. Most examples of ASCII art require a 
        fixed-width font (non-proportional fonts, as on a traditional typewriter) such as Courier for presentation.</p>
    <p>Among the oldest known examples of ASCII art are the creations by computer-art pioneer Kenneth Knowlton from 
        around 1966, who was working for Bell Labs at the time.[1] "Studies in Perception I" by Ken Knowlton and Leon 
        Harmon from 1966 shows some examples of their early ASCII art.[2]</p>
    <p>ASCII art was invented, in large part, because early printers often lacked graphics ability and thus, characters 
        were used in place of graphic marks. Also, to mark divisions between different print jobs from different users, 
        bulk printers often used ASCII art to print large banner pages, making the division easier to spot so that the 
        results could be more easily separated by a computer operator or clerk.[3] ASCII art was also used in early e-mail 
        when images could not be embedded.</p>
